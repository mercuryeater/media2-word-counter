 My fellow citizens, today I stand before you to ask for your support.
 Support for a cause that is bigger than ourselves.
 Support for a vision that will transform our future.
 Support for a movement that will change the world.
 We live in a time of unprecedented challenge and opportunities.
 Challenge that threaten our security, our environment, our economy, our health, our democracy,
 opportunities that offer us new possibilities, new technologies, new partnerships, new horizons.
 We cannot afford to be complacent, indifferent or divided.
 We must act, innovate and unite.
 That is why I am running for president, because I believe that together we can overcome
 the challenge and seize the opportunities together we can build a nation that is stronger
 as martyr, greener, fairer and freer.
 Together we can make history and make difference, but I cannot do it alone.
 I need your support.
 Support me with your boat, your boys, your volunteerism, your vision.
 Support me with your passion, your courage, your geneticity, your wisdom.
 Support me with your hope, your fate, your love, your dreams.
 My fellow citizens, this is our moment.
 This is our chance.
 This is our destiny.
 Let us seize with both hands.
 Let us support each other.
 Let us support our country.
 Let us support our future.
